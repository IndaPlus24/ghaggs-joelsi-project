# Documentation
The work_flowchart was used as a small sketch for the start to help us set up goals and deadlines. Our github workflow was managed by creating branches for different modules(frontend, backend, workspace/flowchart, etc) and then making pull requests with commits that was observed by the other partner before accepted or sent back for improvements. The work was divided in to different modules and proceeded as the work_flowchart text/pdf.
